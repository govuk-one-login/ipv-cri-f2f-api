Dear ((first name)) ((last name)),

To finish proving your identity, you need to go to your chosen Post Office within the next 10 days.

#What you need to take to the Post Office

When you go to the Post Office, make sure to take your:

*chosen photo ID
*Post Office customer letter

You can download your Post Office customer letter at: ((link_to_file))

#At the Post Office

You'll need to show your Post Office customer letter on your phone or tablet, or take a printed copy with you.

A member of Post Office staff will scan your photo ID and take a photo of you.

You’ll find details of your chosen Post Office in your customer letter. But you can go to any Post Office that offers in-branch verification: https://www.postoffice.co.uk/identity/in-branch-verification-service#bf-full-width

If you do not go to the Post Office within the next 10 days, you’ll need to start proving your identity again.

#After you’ve been to the Post Office

You’ll get an email about the result of your identity check - usually within a day of going to the Post Office.
